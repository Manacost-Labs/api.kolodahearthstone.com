# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Made the four HSGuru deck catalogs refresh independently so one upstream
  failure no longer prevents the remaining format/rank datasets from updating.
- Allowed the unified HSGuru matrix to publish a clearly marked partial
  snapshot when one current-format catalog can be restored from the same
  patch's last-known-good data.
- Made a successful Battlegrounds hero-details JSON refresh update the
  compatible hero index too, removing its dependency on a separate premium
  HTML session for freshness.
